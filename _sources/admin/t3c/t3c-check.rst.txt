t3c-check - Traffic Control Cache Configuration generated file check
tool

SYNOPSIS
========

t3c-check <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The t3c-check application has commands for checking things about new
config files, such as whether they can be safely applied or if a service
reload or restart will be required.

For the arguments of a command, see ‘t3c-check <command> --help’.

COMMANDS
========

We divide t3c-check into commands for each independent operation. Each
command is its own application and can be called directly or via the t3c
app. For example, ‘t3c check refs’ or ‘t3c-check refs’ or
‘t3c-check-refs’.
