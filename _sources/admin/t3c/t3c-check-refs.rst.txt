NAME
====

t3c-check-refs - Traffic Control Cache Configuration generated file
reference check tool

SYNOPSIS
--------

t3c-check-refs [-c directory] [-d location] [-e location] [-f files] [-i
location] [-p directory] [file]

[--help]

[--version]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The t3c-check-refs app will read an ATS formatted plugin.config or
remap.config file line by line and verify that the plugin ‘.so’ files
are available in the filesystem or relative to the ATS plugin
installation directory by the absolute or relative plugin filename.

In addition, any plugin parameters that end in ‘.config’, ‘.cfg’, or
‘.txt’ are considered to be plugin configuration files and there
existence in the filesystem or relative to the ATS configuration files
directory is verified.

The configuration file argument is optional. If no config file argument
is supplied, t3c-check-refs reads its config file input from stdin.

OPTIONS
-------

-c, --trafficserver-config-dir=value

::

   directory where ATS config files are stored.
   [/opt/trafficserver/etc/trafficserver]

-f, --files-adding=value

::

   comma-delimited list of file names being added, to not fail
   to verify if they don't already exist.

   Alternatively, this may be "input" in which case the input
   (stdin or the passed argument filename) should be JSON of
   the form:

   {"file": "config-file-text", "adding": ["files-adding"]}

   Where 'config-file-text' is the text of the config file to check
   (which otherwise would have been passed to input unadorned),
   and 'files-adding' is a JSON array of the files added
   (which otherwise would have been passed to --files-adding).
   and the full input is properly formed JSON, with the config
   file escaped for JSON.

   Callers are encouraged to use the --files-adding=input format
   to avoid errors from operating system argument length limits.

-h, --help

::

   Print usage information and exit

-p, --trafficserver-plugin-dir=value

::

   directory where ATS plugins are stored.
   [/opt/trafficserver/libexec/trafficserver]

-s, --silent

::

   Silent. Errors are not logged, and the 'verbose' flag is
   ignored. If a fatal error occurs, the return code will be
   non-zero but no text will be output to stderr

-v, --verbose

::

   Log verbosity. Logging is output to stderr. By default,
   errors are logged. To log warnings, pass '-v'. To log info,
   pass '-vv'. To omit error logging, see '-s'.

-V, --version

::

   Print version information and exit.

EXIT CODES
----------

Returns 0 if no missing plugin DSO or config files are found. Otherwise
the total number of missing plugin DSO and config files are returned.
