NAME
====

t3c - Traffic Control Cache Configuration tools

SYNOPSIS
========

t3c <command> [<args>]

[--help]

[--version]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The ``t3c`` app generates and applies cache configuration for Apache
Traffic Control.

This includes requesting Traffic Ops, generating configuration files for
caching proxies such as Apache Traffic Server, verifying Traffic Ops
data is valid and produces valid config files, creating a git repo for
backups and history, determining whether config changes require a reload
or restart of the caching proxy service, performing that restart, and
more.

The latest version and documentation can be found at
https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/cache-config.
