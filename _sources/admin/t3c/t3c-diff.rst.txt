NAME
====

t3c-diff - Traffic Control Cache Configuration contextual diff tool

SYNOPSIS
========

t3c-diff -a <file-a> -b <file-b> -l <line_comment> -m <file-mode> -u
<file-uid> -g <file-gid>

[--help]

[--version]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The t3c-diff application compares configuration files with semantic
context, omitting comments and other semantically irrelevant text.

This is useful over standard diff tools without context, for example,
when the grammar of a generated comment changes, or a comment contains a
date. This allows operators to avoid updating sematically identical
files, undesirably updating file timestamps, effecting unnecessary
reloads, and other unnecessary and undesirable results.

The input files may be file paths, or ‘stdin’ in which case that file is
read from stdin.

Prints the diff to stdout, and returns the exit code 0 if there was no
diff, 1 if there was a diff. If one file exists but the other doesn’t,
it will always be a diff.

Note this means there may be no diff text printed to stdout but still
exit 1 indicating a diff if the file being created or deleted is
semantically empty.

Mode is file permissions in octal format, default is 0644. Line comment
is a character that signals the line is a comment, default is #

Uid is the User id the file being checked should have, default is
running process’s uid. Gid is the Group id the file being checked should
have, default is running process’s gid.\`
